## **Understand AWS Pricing Models**

### 1. **On-Demand Instances**

- **Pay only for what you use** — no upfront cost or long-term commitment.
- **Billing:** Per second or per hour (depending on the service).
- **Best for:**
    - Short-term workloads
    - Unpredictable usage patterns
    - Development or testing environments
- **Example:**
    - EC2 On-Demand instance — pay hourly for instance runtime.


### 2. **Reserved Instances (RIs)**

- **Commit** to a specific instance type in a region for **1 or 3 years**.
- Offers **up to 75% discount** compared to On-Demand pricing.
- **Payment options:**
  - All Upfront
  - Partial Upfront
  - No Upfront
- **Best for:**
  - Predictable workloads
  - Long-running applications (e.g., databases, web servers)


### 3. **Savings Plans**

- A **flexible alternative** to Reserved Instances.
- Commit to a **consistent spend ($/hour)** for 1 or 3 years.
- Automatically applies discounts to **any eligible service** (e.g., EC2, Fargate, Lambda).
- **Best for:**
  - Workloads with variable instance types or regions
  - Users wanting long-term savings with flexibility


### 4. **Spot Instances**

- Purchase **unused EC2 capacity** at **up to 90% discount** compared to On-Demand.
- Can be **terminated anytime** if AWS needs the capacity.
- **Best for:**
  - Fault-tolerant and flexible workloads (e.g., batch processing, CI/CD, big data analysis)

**Note:** Not ideal for critical or time-sensitive tasks.


### 5. **Dedicated Hosts / Dedicated Instances**

- **Dedicated Host:** Physical server fully allocated to you.
- **Dedicated Instance:** Runs on hardware dedicated to a single customer but managed by AWS.
- **Best for:**
  - Compliance requirements
  - Software licensing needs (e.g., BYOL – Bring Your Own License)


## ⚙️ **Other Cost Factors**

- **Storage (S3, EBS, Glacier):** Pay for the amount of data stored + requests + data transfer.
- **Data Transfer:** Free *into* AWS, but outbound data incurs cost.
- **Support Plans:** Basic (free) to Enterprise-level (paid).
- **Additional Services:** Each AWS service (like RDS, Lambda, CloudFront) has its own pricing model.
