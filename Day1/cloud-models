
# **☁️ AWS Cloud Deployment Models**
# **1️⃣ On-Premises (Traditional Infrastructure)**

📌 Definition:- 
    All IT resources are hosted **inside your organization’s data center**. You own and manage all hardware, storage, networking, and servers.

📌 Key Characteristics:-

* Full control over physical infrastructure
* Requires in-house IT team
* High capital expenditure (CapEx)
* Slow to scale; needs hardware procurement
* Security entirely managed internally

📌 AWS Equivalent Services (for comparison):-
* **AWS Outposts** → Brings AWS hardware/services on-prem
* **VMware Cloud on AWS** → Run your VMware workloads on AWS
* **Storage Gateway** → Connect on-prem storage with AWS

📌 Pros:-
* Maximum control & compliance
* Can meet strict government or financial regulations
* Predictable performance
* No dependency on Internet

📌 Cons:-
* Expensive upfront cost
* Maintenance-intensive
* Slow scaling

📌 Best For:-
* Government & defense projects
* Banks & financial institutions
* Enterprises with strict compliance
* Sensitive workloads

# **2️⃣ AWS Cloud (Public Cloud)**
📌 Definition:- 
     AWS hosts your IT resources (compute, storage, network, databases, etc.) in **its global data centers**. You pay only for what you use (OpEx model).

📌 Core AWS Services:-

| Category   | Services                       | Notes                                       |
| ---------- | ------------------------------ | ------------------------------------------- |
| Compute    | EC2, Lambda, Elastic Beanstalk | EC2 → virtual servers, Lambda → serverless  |
| Storage    | S3, EBS, EFS, Glacier          | Object, block, file storage                 |
| Database   | RDS, DynamoDB, Aurora          | Managed relational & NoSQL databases        |
| Networking | VPC, Route53, Direct Connect   | Secure networking, DNS, hybrid connectivity |
| Security   | IAM, KMS, GuardDuty            | Identity, key management, threat detection  |
| Monitoring | CloudWatch, CloudTrail         | Logs, metrics, auditing                     |

📌 Pros:-
* Scalable & flexible (auto-scaling, load balancers)
* Fast provisioning (minutes vs weeks)
* Low upfront cost (pay-as-you-go)
* Global reach with multiple regions & availability zones
* Managed services reduce operational load

📌 Cons:-
* Ongoing OpEx cost
* Requires internet connectivity
* Vendor lock-in risk

📌 Best For:-
* Startups & SMEs
* Fast-scaling apps (e-commerce, SaaS, fintech)
* AI/ML workloads
* Disaster recovery & backup

# **3️⃣ Hybrid Cloud (AWS + On-Prem)**

📌 Definition:-
    A combination of your **on-premises data center** + **AWS Cloud**. Some workloads run locally, while others run on AWS for scalability, DR, or cloud migration.

📌 AWS Services Supporting Hybrid:-

| Service             | Purpose                                          |
| ------------------- | ------------------------------------------------ |
| AWS Outposts        | Run AWS hardware & services on-prem              |
| AWS Direct Connect  | Dedicated network connection from on-prem to AWS |
| Storage Gateway     | Connect on-prem storage to AWS cloud             |
| VMware Cloud on AWS | Run VMware workloads in AWS environment          |
| AWS Backup          | Centralized backup for on-prem + cloud           |

📌 Pros:-
* Flexible: keep sensitive data on-prem, scale in cloud
* Smooth migration to cloud
* Disaster recovery with cloud
* High availability

📌 Cons:-
* Complex setup & management
* Skilled IT staff required
* Cost of both on-prem + cloud

📌 Best For:-
* Large enterprises with legacy apps
* Companies migrating gradually to AWS
* Regulated industries (healthcare, banking)
* Disaster recovery and backup solutions
